    "## **Key Findings:**\n",
    "- **Market Trends:**  \n",
    "   - The S&P 500 shows a steady upward trend over the years, with significant volatility observed during market crashes (e.g., 2008 and 2020).\n",
    "   - Average daily returns were relatively low, but the long-term growth trend has been strong.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Volatility:**  \n",
    "   - Volatility spiked during economic crises, reflecting significant fluctuations in stock prices. This was particularly noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Correlation:**  \n",
    "   - Strong positive correlation observed between the closing price and volume, suggesting higher trading activity during market rallies.\n",
    "   - Negative correlation observed between returns and volatility, indicating that higher returns are often accompanied by lower volatility periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Challenges Faced:**\n",
    "- **Data Quality:**  \n",
    "   - The dataset required cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure accurate results. This involved filling missing data and removing outliers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Feature Selection:**  \n",
    "   - Selecting relevant financial indicators for analysis and ensuring the integrity of the data involved testing and iterative modeling.\n",
